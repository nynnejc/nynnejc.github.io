# 3D Modeling and Reconstruction with Blender & Unity 
### Organised by the Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities (GCDH)

2–6 March 2015 I participated in a 3D spring school at the University of Göttingen, Germany. This was really my first experience learning how to model and reconstruct 3d objects. 

The GCDH is led by Prof. Dr. Martin Langner, who has specialized in virtual museums. One of his projects involves a sculpture collection from the renaissance, but built up in the 18th century, publishing the sculptures as 3d models.  The sculptures were mostly moved to Vienna. Both collections were completely destroyed. By using old inventory lists it was possible to recreate this museum collection virtually even though it has been lost. Prof. Langner talked about a future project with an archeological research databases where you don’t put in words but shapes, 3d scans. 

##### The workshop was coached by Johanna Pirker and Phil Gosch

[Johanna Pirker](http://jpirker.com/) has studied at the Graz university and Massachusetts University of Technology. Her field of interest is Game design/theory, Cultural Heritage, Virtual worlds for learning and collaboration. Making visualisations for making the unseen seen. Visualisations for architecture. Explorative learning: several students meet in a virtual environment, like a scavenger hunt you have to find clues and solve a puzzle. Immersion and virtual reality. [Phil Gosch](http://www.saphirestudio.at/) studies at Graz University and is a 3D artist, game developer. Blender community member. 

##### The main tools we used for the workshop were: 

1. Blender: 3D modelling from scratch, drawings. 

2. Unity: 3D models created using photographs. 

Most games/ worlds needs scripts. Resources for finding free models and tools online that you can reuse in your virtual world.

##### The interactive aspect
 
Audio experiences: hearing your footsteps for example. Simulations of things you can interact with. Games, collaborations. 


##### My own Interest in 3D Technology

My interests are material culture, art history, digital humanities. Museum practice: virtual exhibitions. Databases.
What I expect from this course: a thorough introduction to the different programs and current research practices.
What I want to learn: I want to use both technologies to create 3D models, both using photographs and making drawings/renderings from scratch.
Did I bring any particular research questions. No, for me this is a learning course, simply for fun and for getting an introduction that I can build from.
What are your expectations: that I get the tools to go on on my own with this. 

##### Virtual Heritage definition by Stone & Ojika, 2000 

“*(It is) the use of computer-based technologies to record, preserve, or recreate artifacts, sites and actors of histoic, artistic, religious, and cultural significance and to deliver the results openly to a global audience in such a way as to provide formative educational experiences through electronic manipulations of time and space.*” [Source](https://books.google.de/books?id=lbm1CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=Stone+and+Ojika+The+use+of+computer-based&source=bl&ots=PA53Uh1oRM&sig=SufLH8lhiJ3UA-4-qm7iavP6jbk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwit5I-404fPAhUGdCwKHdKpDMoQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=Stone%20and%20Ojika%20The%20use%20of%20computer-based&f=false).

E-learning. 
Framework for interactive 
Mechanics: components of the game
Dynamics: run-time behavior of the mechanics
Aesthetics: 

Iterative Game Design Process:
come up with a basic idea
Implement a prototype that demonstrates the idea
Playtest it.
Revise.
Repeat

### Sources for 3D

1. 3D scanner. Time efficient but costly.
2. 3D modeling: Design using modeling tools, i.e. blender.


##### 3D Objects. Different kinds of objects
Polygonal Objects
NURBS/Bezier surfaces
Metaballs
Volumetrics Objects
Particles
Realtime:
we will create polygon meshes
in real time environments polygon meshes are used

Polygonal Object Terms
Meshes consists of: Verticles, Edges, Triangles, Quads, N-gons.

Blender
3D content creation software. Open source, free. Originally developed as in-house software at NeoGeo. NaN developed Blender, then went bancrupt. But then the Blender Foundation was created. 

Blender used for:
creating 3D objects from scratch.
create virtual worlds.
modify 3D objects created in other software.
Animate 3D objects.

We will be using
Blender
VisualSFM

and end up using Unity


Creating a 3D Model in Blender:
Modeling
UV-Wrapping
Texturing
Animating
Exporting to Unity
Using Python Scripting

Blender:
you can hide or recall the bar on the left side by pressing “t” and on the right side by pressing “n”.

Selection:
RMB (right mouse click) to select
Hold “shift” to add or remove
to delete. First delete and then hit “x” to delete.



Unity:
Unity uses C# (C sharp), JavaScript or Boo to code. To create a new file a new project. You can set it to either 2D or 3D. You have different packages you can work with. We will use the sample package that we downloaded this morning. Think of a scene as one level in a computer game. The asset store has a lot of free resources and models.

UV_Wrapping/Mapping:
placing an image on top of a 3D shape. First you flatten the model, like an unfolded paper plane that has color applied to it, and then its re-folded. The software does all the folding and unfoldng! 


Photogrammetry:
The science of making measurements from photographs.
Aerial Photogrammetry or close-range photogrammetry. Structure from motion. Creating 3D models from sequence of 2D images combined with a motion signal. 

VisualSFM:
Free software for personal, non-profit. 

Agisoft Photoscan:
Cost money but 30-day trial version. 

Autodesk 123D Catch:
Easy and fast, not as high quality or reaching up to academic standards. 

A big list of photogrammetry Software. You should use whichever you think is most helpful.
