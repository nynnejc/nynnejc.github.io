# 3D pattern software

1. [Vectorworks](http://www.vectorworks.net/) less expensive than Acad, but easier to use. It is just a CAD program, not specific to pattern drafting, but easy to make your own symbols etc.

2. [Autocad](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview) seems to be what most people use, but pricy.

3. [Sartology](http://www.sartology.com/demo/) is basically a pen tool (similar to Adobe Illustrator) with measurements. You can export what you’ve drawn to SVG file that you can later open in Illustrator or Inkscape. It’s not yet a full CAD system but it’s a good start for pattern makers who need to draw patterns from scratch.

4. [Inkskape](https://inkscape.org/en/) is free, open source.

5. [Valentina](http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/free-pattern-making-software-valentina-0-3-released) free pattern making software. Specifically marketed to programmers.

6. [OpenFit](http://mariobehling.de/tags/openfit) Open Source project for modeling trouser patterns.

7. [SodaCAD](http://www.sodacad.org/) is an open source pattern making CAD suite, with capabilities similar to Optitex, Tukatech, or Gerber’s Accumark.

8. [Tau Meta](http://www.taumeta.org/) blog post on creating a Pattern as an Inkscape Extension.
